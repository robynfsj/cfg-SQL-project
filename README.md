# CFG SQL Course Project

## Code First Girls: Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming Course
I undertook the Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming course run by Code First Girls during summer 2020. It is an 8 week introductory course and was my first experience of databases and SQL. The course covered:

• database creation, structure and management  
• basic queries  
• queries with conditions, group by, having    
• subqueries  
• joins and the union operator  
• transactions  
• views  
• stored functions  
• stored procedures  
• events  
• triggers  
• backups  

## Course Project
This repository contains my final project that I created as a requirement of the course. It is a database that contains details of bookings made at an imaginary holiday retreat. The [create_database.sql](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/create_database.sql) script contains the code used to create and populate the tables while the [tasks.sql](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/tasks.sql) script contains the code used to complete the various queries and tasks we were asked to complete such as creating views, stored procedures, running subqueries etc. The repository also contains a backup of the database ([retreat_backup.sql](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/retreat_backup.sql)). The project was presented to the rest of the group remotely ([presentation.pdf](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-SQL-project/blob/master/presentation.pdf)).
